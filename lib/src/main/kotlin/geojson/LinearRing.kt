/**
 * RF7646 discusses the concept of a Linear Ring in section 3.1.6:
 * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.6
 *
 * A Linear Ring is not explicitly represented as a GeoJSON geometry type,
 * instead being a sequence of positions with certain properties.
 *
 * Maintaining consistency with RF7646, this library will also avoid an object
 * representation of LinearRing, instead providing functions to manipulate
 * sequences of positions with respect to the Linear Ring definition.
